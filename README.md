# Three-Level Password System

## Overview

The *Three-Level Password System* is a conceptual security mechanism that enhances user authentication by incorporating three different levels of verification:

1. *Textual Password Authentication*: The user enters a traditional textual password.
2. *Graphical Password Authentication*: The user selects a sequence of images or patterns (simulated with a numeric sequence in this example).
3. *Biometric Authentication*: The user is authenticated using biometric data (simulated with a simple string in this example).

This system aims to provide robust security against unauthorized access by layering these authentication methods.

## Features

- *Enhanced Security*: Combines knowledge-based, recognition-based, and biometric authentication.
- *User-Friendly*: Simple interface and easy-to-use process.
- *Bot and Hacker Resistant*: Provides strong protection against automated and brute-force attacks.
